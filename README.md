Biomass based power project by Shri Shyam Warehousing and Power Pvt. Ltd, Banari, Chhattisgarh

The project activity, Biomass based power project by Shri Shyam Warehousing and Power Pvt.
Ltd, Banari, Chhattisgarh is located at Village: Banari, District: Janjgir, State: Chhattisgarh,
Country: India.


Purpose of the UCR project activity:
The project activity involves the installation of a 10 MW biomass (rice husk) based cogeneration
power plant to generate electricity by utilising the renewable biomass potential available in the
region, thereby reducing GHG emissions. The project activity achieves GHG emission
reductions by supplying the net electricity generated to the Northern, Eastern, Western, and
North-Eastern (NEWNE) grid which is predominantly dependent on fossil fuel based power
plants.

The project proponent (PP) Shri Shyam Warehousing and Power (P) Limited (SSWPPL) has
entered into a long term power purchase agreement (PPA) with the Chhattisgarh State Power
Distribution Company Limited (CSPDCL) dated 19.12.2007 for the supply of 10 MWh power to
the grid and a supplementary PPA dated 16.04.2012 for the supply of 9 MWh power to the grid
for a period of 20 years (source). Hence the commissioning date or start date of this UCR
project activity is 19/12/2007. 

Though the project is a co-generation project, the PP is entitled to
claim UCR CoUs based only on the renewable electrical energy supplied to grid as per the UCR
CoU program policy and guidelines related to small scale biomass to grid power projects. In the
absence of project activity, the PP would have continued operating its existing two (2) units of
rice husk fired boilers and the grid would have purchased fossil electricity from other power
plants.
